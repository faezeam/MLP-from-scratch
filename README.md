# MLP-from-scratch
I tried to implement Multilayer Perceptron without any framework like Keras or similar ones. </br>
The data was [fashion mnist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist), Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.</br> 
Different activation fuctions such as linear, softmax, relu, tanh was tested and the suitable one can be chosen based on the data.</br>
For optimiser i implemented SGD, Momentum_SGD, Adagrad, RMSprop, Adam.
